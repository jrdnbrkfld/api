## User Stories

As this is the back-end of the project, it's sole focus is on the administrative side of the website. Therefore, there is only one user story that needs to be addressed:

- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete the users, posts, comments and likes, so that I can have a control over the content of the application and remove any potential inappropriate content

## Database

The models shown were created to represent the database model structure of the application:
